## Description

  This project is a real-time license plate recognition system designed to monitor parking zones. It utilizes YOLO object detection models to recognize vehicles and read their license plates from a live video feed or CCTV footage. The system checks each detected license plate against a database of authorized vehicles and sends email notifications for unauthorized vehicles. The results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
